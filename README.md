# Calculator

Calculators are not only one of the most useful tools available, but they are also a great way to understand UI and event processing in an application. In this problem you will create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic calculations on integers.

The styling is up to you so use your imagination and get creative! You might also find it worth your time to experiment with the calculator app on your mobile device to better understand basic functionality and edge cases.

## üöÄ Starting

These instructions allowed you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### üìã Prerequisites

The following programs are required to use and modify the project.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### üîß Instalation

A series of step-by-step examples that tell you what you must do to get a development environment running.

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mateus2a/calculator calculator

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd calculator

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application
$ npm start
```

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
